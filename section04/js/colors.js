/* 

Below, you will write a JavaScript function that changes the color displayed
for a candidate on the list of endorsements. The function should take
a string that represents the name of a candidate and another string
that represents a hex color code, such as "#FF0000".

Once you think your function is complete, try calling it at the bottom of this file.

*/

function change_color(candidate, color) {
	/* 
		1. Fill in the blank
		
		Change the following line so that it gets all of the list 
		items representing endorsements into an array called candidates. 
		Uncomment the line when ready.
		
		Hint: Try using console.log below to check if you are getting the candidates array correctly.
		
	*/
	
	// var candidates = _______.getElementsByTagName("__");
	
	/*
		2. Finish the for loop and if statement
		
		2.1 Finish the loop so that it loops through each of the 
		list items in the array you just created.
		
		2.2 For each of the list items, if the inner text includes
		the name of the candidate, set the background color to the
		new color specified in the function inputs.
		Uncomment the following lines when ready.
	*/
	
	// for ( ___ ; ____ ; ___ ) {
		// if (____.innerHTML.includes(____)) {
			// ____.style._____ = ____;
		// }
	// }
	
	/*
		3. Call it
		
		When you think your function will work, call it below
		according to the instructions.
		
		(As a good practice, remember to use hex codes, not 
		color names, to specify colors.)
		
		
		4. Bonus
		
		Augment this function to check that color is correctly
		formatted as a hex code and output an error message to the
		console if not.
		
		Hint: use regex and console.log()
	
		
		
		5. Bonus Bonus
		
		Too easy? Come up with an equivalent way to implement 
		this function using jQuery! (No hints this time.)

	Examples to try:
	
	1. Breaking news! Bernie Sanders has decided to run as 
	an independent. Use the function to change all endorsements 
	for Bernie so they appear in green instead of blue 
	in the list of endorsements.
	
	2. Donald Trump has started his own party, the Trump Party.
	Its official color is gold. Use the function to change
	endorsements for Trump so they appear as gold instead of red.
	
	3. Change the candidate of your choice to the color of your choice.
