					The 2014-2015 year was an overwhelming success for Golden Opportunity. This year more students benefited from tutoring than ever before, more funds were raised than during any other year, a paid administrative position was funded for the first time and the Board of Directors functioned as a more efficient, cohesive and productive unit than it had been in years past. As GO completes its first decade of service, there is a much to reflect on with a sense of accomplishment and pride.<br>

					Last year 70 students received expert tutoring from 65 full time tutors in grades two through eight at eight elementary and two middle schools. There were also eight substitute tutors on the GO roster. The past school year marked the first year of tutoring at Northeast Elementary School, the last of the eight elementary schools to join GO. Four new students received one-on-one help at this school as tutoring proceeded seamlessly at this new venue. As in the past, the strength of GO has once again been the organizational structure of the program marked by strong building liaisons in each school overseeing and managing problems along the way, before they develop into serious issues.<br>

					Over the past twelve months the GO Board of Directors has undertaken a significant workload in creating a more professional profile for the organization. The fundraising and marketing committee worked tirelessly to overhaul the outdated mailing campaign by creating new brochures, mailers and envelopes and doubling the mailing list, all to great effect. The grant writing committee's diligent work paid benefits when two unexpected grants came through in midyear. Members of the Just Be Cause Silent Auction committee pulled together a highly professional and profitable display at the GO summer benefit. With a new board chairman running meetings, setting agendas and chairing meetings, the managing director is freer to focus on administrative issues. More than at any juncture in the history of GO, the board of directors has become a working body of dedicated members, each contributing something to the mix.<br>

					In conclusion, I am pleased to say that GO has continued to grow in a variety of ways. As in the past, the organization has grown cautiously and with great consideration and care about how it has expanded and moved forward. Our greatest concern has always been to help the children whom we serve. Based on the feedback we receive from parents, guardians, teachers, principals, students, tutors and the superintendent, we have been very successful.

					The 2013-2014 school year was the ninth in GO's organizational history. Each year the program has expanded in some fashion. In February of 2014 GO initiated tutoring at Caroline School, the seventh of the eight ICSD elementary schools. At the GO board of directors meeting in June 2014 approval was granted to extend tutoring to Northeast School, the eighth and last elementary school in the district.<br>

					During the 2014-2015 school year GO tutors will provide one-on-one tutoring help for approximately 70 low-income ICSD students in grades 2-8 with a staff of about 65 tutors. The strength of GO continues to be the individual tutoring relationship formed between each tutor and student. Initially, GO tutors are thoughtfully paired with their student by the building liaison at each school. Most tutors spend considerable time planning for and reflecting upon each tutoring session.<br>

					Many tutoring relationships develop into mentoring relationships in which the students come to rely upon their tutors to provide guidance, direction and inspiration. To keep tutors aware of current educational trends, GO administration provides specialized training for tutors in specific curriculum areas. In 2013-14 math training was provided on three occasions throughout the year.<br>

					A highlight of the past year was the nine-minute documentary about GO made by local film maker, Peter Carroll. Donating his own time to interview tutors, a GO parent, the GO director and the superintendent of schools, Mr. Carroll, wove a narrative about GO through the voices of participants. The short film tells the story of GO in a compelling manner. It has already been used to help persuade potential corporate sponsors to back the program. The DVD has also been used in several grant packages and will be featured on the GO website.<br>

					As GO has evolved as an organization it has continued to move in a direction of sustaining itself. To that means, GO has been seeking corporate sponsors in the past six months. So far, GO has three corporate sponsors who have contributed over $7,500 in sponsorship funding. In the coming months GO will continue to seek more corporate sponsors.<br>

					GO moves into the next school year with high hopes. GO tutors are happy, satisfied with their work and proud of what they have accomplished. Parents and classroom teachers have consistently told our tutors that we are helping their children. Contributions from private donors, foundations and corporations have been better than ever. We are optimistic that the best for GO is yet to come.<br>

					During my tenure as the director it has become clear to me that the GO organizational skills have steadily improved and we have fine-tuned the management of our systems. GO has become extremely skilled at providing high quality tutoring and mentoring services for students in grades one through eight for many reasons. One reason we have succeeded is that GO tutors stay up-to-date with changes in the curriculum. When the elementary schools incorporated the new Singapore Math Program, all GO elementary tutors were required to attend Singapore training sessions before the start of tutoring. Then, based on what GO administration was hearing from tutors in the field, we asked math expert Ann Caren to offer extra Singapore training at our January meeting. Finally, in response to the positive reaction to her mid-year work, we brought Ann back for an additional math session for elementary tutors in April.<br>

					At the middle school level, beginning this school year (2013-2014), retired middle school math teacher and GO tutor, Dick Lajza, will be offering one-on-one tutoring to GO tutors who need catch-up help themselves. GO will be paying the tutors and Dick for however much time is needed to get them to a place where they feel competent teaching middle school math. In addition, based on students' low test performance in class and on standardized tests, Dick will be offering extra math tutorials for small groups of GO middle school students on GO's off days, Mondays and Wednesdays.<br>

					As GO Director I communicate with Ithaca City School District administrators Matt Landahl, Chief Elementary School Officer and Jason Trumble, Chief Secondary Officer, and ask them to keep me current on changes in curriculum and workshops that GO tutors can be considered to attend. The Ithaca School District has been generous in sharing its staff development resources with GO for the betterment of our tutors and the ICSD students.<br>

					Over the past year individual GO elementary schools met two to three times each for “sharing sessions.” Tutors met in small groups at their schools and discussed how their individual tutoring was going or talked specifically about previously chosen topics such as math or reading comprehension.  These sessions were extremely popular and helped foster a sense of community at each school. They also served as problem solving sessions. This year we hope to meet across the GO schools by grade level.<br>

					With a large number of new tutors on board last year Assistant Director Ann Halpern and I personally called each new tutor in November to check in on them. We also asked building liaisons to make a concerted effort to mentor new tutors and help them have a smooth start.<br>

					In the late spring documentary filmmaker Peter Carroll approached GO and asked if he could volunteer his time to make a short movie about the organization featuring a number of tutor/student pairs to tell the story. Peter and I visited with about eight pairs as possible subjects for the endeavor. The project will begin in earnest this fall and will be a yearlong venture with a projected release time of early fall 2014.<br>

					Another significant event in the history of GO is that the composition of the board of directors has dramatically changed. In its first eight years the GO boards have been primarily composed of educators. While these boards have helped GO grow as a strong tutoring and mentoring program, the members had very little business experience. However, in the past three months GO has added seven new board members and two college advisors to its board. The new members are people from the business community:  a certified public accountant, a financial wealth advisor, a former marketing executive, a physician, a stay-at-home mom with a financial background, a marriage and family therapist, an operations management specialist a business school major (intern) and a Human Ecology Professor and a Coordinator of Field Experiences in Education. With the addition of board members with a business background GO hopes to raise its profile in the community, build an image branding campaign and generate a more effective fund raising program.<br>

					Last year GO tutored as many as 62 students with 52 tutors.  There were certainly areas that needed improvement. Good communication between tutors and teachers is sometimes lacking and in need of improvement. Teaching and tutoring is a people business and there are many personalities involved so there is a great variety of styles and differences in tone and communication skills. Every year the importance of communication with classroom teachers is strongly emphasized but it continues to be a difficult problem for our tutors; we will continue to work at it. Perhaps more support from principals would be useful in this area. At this time, however, the plusses far outweigh the minuses and GO moves into its ninth year ready, willing and able to help Ithaca's low-income students. <br>
